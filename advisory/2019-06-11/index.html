<h1>CloudBees Security Advisory 2019-06-11</h1>
<p>This advisory announces vulnerabilities in<strong>
Jenkins, CloudBees Jenkins Distribution, CloudBees Jenkins Platform and CloudBees Core.
</strong></p>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1399'>XML External Entity processing vulnerability in Token Macro Plugin</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1399</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Token Macro Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This allowed attackers able to control the contents of files processed with the <code>${XML}</code> macro to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Token Macro Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1379'>CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in JX Resources Plugin</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1379</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JX Resources Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified Kubernetes server and obtain information about an attacker-specified namespace.
Doing so might also leak service account credentials used for the connection.
Additionally, it allowed attackers to obtain the value of any attacker-specified environment variable for the Jenkins master process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1410 (1)'>CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in ElectricFlow Plugin allowed SSRF</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1410 (1)</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A missing permission check in a form validation method in ElectricFlow Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1410 (2)'>Missing permission checks in ElectricFlow Plugin</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1410 (2)</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various form validation and form autocompletion methods in ElectricFlow Plugin lacked permission checks.
This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to obtain information about the configuration of ElectricFlow Plugin, as well as the configuration and data of connected ElectricFlow servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These form validation and autocompletion methods now require Overall/Administer or Job/Configure permission, as appropriate for the given method.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1411'>ElectricFlow Plugin globally and unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1411</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ElectricFlow Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM during the deployment/publication of an application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ElectricFlow Plugin no longer does that.
Instead, the existing opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors is used during deployment for the specific connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This issue was caused by an incomplete fix for <a href="../2019-02-19/#SECURITY-937">SECURITY-937</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1412'>XSS vulnerability in build metadata contributed by ElectricFlow Plugin</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1412</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plugin adds metadata displayed on build pages during its operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any user content was not escaped, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability allowing users with Job/Configure permission, or attackers controlling API responses received from ElectricFlow to render arbitrary HTML and JavaScript on Jenkins build pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Build metadata is now filtered through a HTML formatter that only allows showing basic HTML, neutralizing any unsafe data.
Additionally, all builds executed after the security update is applied will now properly escape content received from ElectricFlow.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1420'>XSS vulnerability in ElectricFlow Plugin affecting job configuration forms</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1420</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuration forms of various post-build steps contributed by ElectricFlow Plugin were vulnerable to cross-site scripting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This allowed attackers able to control the output of connected ElectricFlow servers' APIs to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the configuration form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ElectricFlow Plugin no longer interprets HTML/JavaScript in responses from ElectricFlow server APIs on job configuration forms.</p>
</div>
