<h1>CloudBees Security Advisory 2019-05-21</h1>
<p>This advisory announces vulnerabilities in<strong>
Jenkins, CloudBees Jenkins Distribution, CloudBees Jenkins Platform and CloudBees Core.
</strong></p>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1316'>Missing permission check allowed obtaining limited information about system configuration in PAM Authentication Plugin</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1316 / CVE-2019-10319</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A missing permission check in PAM Authentication Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to invoke a form validation method to obtain limited information about the file <code>/etc/shadow</code> on systems with that file present, as well as the system user the Jenkins process is running as.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on configuration, one of the following messages could be obtained by an attacker:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"Jenkins needs to be able to read /etc/shadow"</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>"(1) needs to belong to group (2) to read /etc/shadow"</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>"Either Jenkins needs to run as (3) or (1) needs to belong to group (2) and 'chmod g+r /etc/shadow' needs to be done to enable Jenkins to read /etc/shadow"</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>"Success"</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The numeric placeholders in the messages above would be populated with the following values:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The system user that the Jenkins master process is running as (usually <code>jenkins</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group owning <code>/etc/shadow</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user owning <code>/etc/shadow</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This form validation method now requires Overall/Administer permission.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='SECURITY-1322'>Certificate file read vulnerability in Credentials Plugin</h3>
<strong>SECURITY-1322 / CVE-2019-10320</strong>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of Certificate credentials from a PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins master.
Users with permission to create or update credentials could use the associated form validation to confirm the existence of files with an attacker-specified path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, they could create credentials from any valid PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins master.
With the ability to configure jobs to access these credentials, they could obtain the certificate content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Credentials Plugin no longer supports Certificate credentials from PKCS#12 files on the Jenkins master file system.
Existing Certificate credentials of this kind are automatically migrated to <em>directly entered</em> Certificate credentials during Jenkins startup.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to technical limitations, these migrated credentials are not immediately persisted.
In rare situations a non-administrator user might access a credential migrated this way and encounter a permission error.
The solution is to save affected credentials manually, either individually through the UI or with the following script for the Script Console:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.CredentialsProvider.saveAll()</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation may impact performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In almost all cases the automatic migration will work and these additional steps will be unnecessary.</p>
